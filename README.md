- âš¡**TOOLS:** HTML, CSS, SASS, Gulp, JS <br>
- ðŸ¥…**GOALS and DECISIONS:** Although a small project, I wanted to get more out of SASS than I have in the past. I made more use of variables this time around, and made sure to separate concerns with partials and imports (I understand @import is depreciated now). I also used GULP for the first time, and used pure CSS to create a hamburger menu.<br>
- ðŸŒ±**FUTURE:** I enjoyed making this. In the future I want to put together something a little bigger and more complex, with a mind to using SASS to its fuller potential.
